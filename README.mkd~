ARSlides Version 1.0 by Enekochan <http://tech.enekochan.com/>

ABOUT
=====

ARSlides is a Augmented Reality slide presentation application.


DEPENDENCIES
============

ARSlides  uses Collada-dom , ARToolKit, OpenSceneGraph and osgART
libraries for the Augmente Reality and 3D. If you need a easy way
to install them check out my installation-scripts repository in
https://github.com/enekochan/installation-scripts

It also uses libtinyxml-dev so you would have to install like this:

sudo apt-get install libtinyxml-dev


USE
===

This is a Eclipse-CDT project so once you have installed all the
dependencies you should be able to open it on Eclipse-CDT and just
build and run it.

You have to configure the data/config.xml file with your webcam configuration
and your slide files (they can be PNG, JPG, TGA, GIF, DAE, 3DS, OSG,
OBJ and FBX file types). Then you should be good to go.


TODO
====

 - Support for video file slides (a new branch called "video_slide_support"
 is going to be created for this, so check it out).
 - Different transitions between slides.
